# PoBe-Node-React-practice
A basic tutorial of utilizing Node.js, React.js, and Express.js to create and display a component on a webpage

To run: Make sure the latest versions of node.js and npm are installed. Then install express.js, express-react-views, react, and react-dom.

Once everything is installed and up-to-date, simply go to the projects root directory in your command line or terminal and run the following command:
  
$ node app.js dev

This will then run on a local port, which can be viewed in a web browser once the server is run properly (achieved with the previous command)
